# Caleb Maddry's Repo for APPM 4600: Numerical Methods
## Description
This is my repository for APPM 4600, a class I took in Fall of 2024. I really liked this class and it was my favorite applied math class. For the final project, I looked at Newton's Method for optimization. I implemented Newton's Method, "Lazy Newton", the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm, the DFP alogrithm, and the symmetric rank 1 update (SR1). I also looked at Trust Region methods and discussed how they can be an effective  alternative to line search methods. 

For this project I realied heavily on [Numerical Optimization](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-40065-5) by Jorge Nocedal and Stephen J. Wright. This textbook is fantastic and might be my favorite textbook of all time. It's beautifully written and incredibly clear. I wrote up a final report and did a presentation on it at the end of class. Normally people work in groups of 3 for the final project, but I decided to work on it alone. This was a terrible idea, because the project was a ton of work, but I had fun regardless!
